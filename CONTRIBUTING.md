# Contributing

We encourage everyone to join and contribute.

We want to gather as many valuable resources as possible for anyone who wants to learn about Palestine.

## Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to contribute, but here are some guidelines to consider:

* Only add valuable resources; make sure the resource adds value to the readers or followers.
* Only authorized resources; we need authorized sources that are proven not to spread fake news.
* No propaganda; there is a lot of propaganda websites and social accounts, please add objective sources only.
